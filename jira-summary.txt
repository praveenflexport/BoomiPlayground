4. Useful Notes for Regression or Rollout:
   - The deployment of the update was initially unsuccessful, possibly due to a network issue. This needs to be investigated to avoid such issues in the future.
   - A code review was performed by Kiran.
   - The error messages were updated multiple times based on the feedback and test results.
   - The due date for the UAT testing was updated to EOD Monday.
   - A blocker related to database access was resolved.
   - The priority of this issue was higher than internal initiatives like AI exploration / Demand FFA projects.
   - The error message for missing V102 & V104 needs to be fixed as it is not accurate.
   - Whenever the due date is adjusted, the “Reporter” should be checked with to see if the new date would work or if this needs any prioritization.
