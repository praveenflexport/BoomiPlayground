1. The changes made between versions 190 and 195 of the component are related to the error messages displayed when certain conditions are not met in the process. Specifically, the error messages for three business rules have been updated. The first change is in the error message for rule 15, where the reference to "Equipment Details" has been replaced with "Shipment Details" and the instructions for providing the required information have been made more specific. The second change is in the error message for rule 22, where the instructions for providing the required information have been updated to be more specific. The third change is in the error message for rule 13, where the reference to "Flight Number for Air" has been replaced with "HAWB for Air".
2. The component name "Partner - Infor Nexus - EDI 856" suggests that this change supports the integration with Infor Nexus, a supply chain management platform, and is related to the EDI 856 transaction set, which is used for Advance Ship Notice/Manifest.
3. The impact of this change is likely to be low risk as it only involves updating error messages and does not change the underlying logic of the process. However, it could potentially lead to confusion if users are not informed about the updated error messages. There are no obvious edge cases as the changes are straightforward.
4. The changes can be inspected in the Boomi UI under the Process tab, specifically in the configuration of shapes 39 and 42 where the business rules are defined.
5. As mentioned earlier, the affected EDI transaction is 856, which is used for Advance Ship Notice/Manifest. Given the nature of this transaction set, it is likely to be outbound as it is typically sent from the supplier to the buyer to provide detailed information about a shipment.
6. The scale of the change is small as it only involves updating error messages. Testing could involve triggering the error conditions to ensure that the updated messages are displayed correctly. Rollback would involve reverting the error messages to their previous state.
